# Course materials for ECON407 Winter 2019
In reality: you are **guinea pigs** for the new course (where here we will emphasize slightly more macro content)

* ECON323 "Quantitative Economic Modeling with Data Science Applications"
* Testing out a new textbook "QuantEcon DataScience: Introduction to Economic Modeling and Data Science"

Previous **programming experience** and classwork is useful, but **not required**.

However, for those coming in with advanced Python skills, you can use this as an opportunity to learn Julia and/or R for the first parts of the course

## Computational Setup

You will not need to install any software on your local computer.  You can use the online Jupyter environment from Syzygy
To setup, go to [ECON407 Syzygy Setup](https://ubc.syzygy.ca/jupyter/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https://github.com/ubcecon/ECON407_2019&app=lab)

In the next few weeks, we will give you an HTML and additional repository with a similarly easy setup
