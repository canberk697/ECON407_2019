## Macro Topics/Quantitative Economic Modeling with Data Science Applications
 
- **Instructor:** jesse.perla@ubc.ca and schrimpf@mail.ubc.ca 
- **Textbook:** New online textbook "QuantEcon DataScience: Introduction to Economic Modeling and Data Science"
- **Learning Environment:** Come to class on time.  Bring a laptop if you can!

## Course Overview
This is a course introducing the computational and data science tools used in modern economics.

We will apply a programming language (Python) to analyzing these sorts of
data and making numerical calculations/simulations of models in economics.

The class will focus on practical experience with economics-focused tools and is not
intended as a replacement for Computer Science or Statistics courses.

## Course Materials and Communications
All materials will be provided online:
- Class Materials: https://github.com/ubcecon/ECON407_2019
- Communications, Announcements, and Grades: http://canvas.ubc.ca

## Grading

- Weekly problem sets: 50%
- Final projects: 45%
- Attendance/Participation: 5% (basically, 5% given or 0% if we think you have attendance problems outside of the ordinary)
